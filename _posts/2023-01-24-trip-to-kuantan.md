Alif curry house was a bit disaapointment. May be a bad day for them to manage more customers.

Sri Suria Curry house was amazing with delicious south indian food and good portion sizes. We had banana leaf meals and dosa and roti canai and all tasted good. 

We found delicious red beans curry (Rajma) with arabic bread at Alkawthar. We loved it and we all were full that night.

Overall there was plenty of availability of food up to out taste buds in Kuantan.

Finally on day3 we got the oportunity to go for the river cruise. Kids were really excited. We had our coffee at Mc Donalds which was just beside the rivercruise jetty. Mc Donalds really had nice river view from its first floor dining area and also allowed a free parking. We baught the tickets for rivercruise on the jetty counter. Ticket price RM25/Adult and RM20/Kid.

It was 1.5 Hours rivercruise and had points to look for eagles and distant look to few crocodiles.it was fun on a sunny morning.

Then we drove again to Suria Curry house for the lunch.
